My Curated List of bitcoin (onchain and lightning) merchants.

Contributing
--------------

To contribute, simply update ``merchanges-list.md`` in the similar format and then copy it across to README.md

Then remove the top 4 lines in README.md

Lastly, create a branch and commit the changes and send a pull request

For verification of businesses, just do the same thing and add some proof to the pull request or simply [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/bitcoin-merchants/issues/new) about it.

Using webpage mode
--------------

* Run ``bundle install``
* Run ``bundle exec jekyll serve`` (or replace serve with build)

The above will generate the list into a static HTML page.

Currently we aren't using any HTML page as of now.


Verification Statuses
--------------

⚠️  = Means that the business accepts the bitcoin but might have problems. Or the business hasn't been verified to have taken bitcoin. If you have success please [report it here](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/bitcoin-merchants/issues/new). It is important that you let us know if it was lightning or non-lightning.

✅ = Means they have taking bitcoin recently

❌ = Means they no longer take bitcoin, and should be removed from the list
